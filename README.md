# Hello and welcome! 
## feel free to look around :)

My name is Stella, and I am a first year Frontend design & development student. 
 Iâ€™m currently working on the main page for a webshop, as well as the art & music for an action-packed sidescroller created for the Pirate Software Game Jam.

If you are interested in contacting me, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
